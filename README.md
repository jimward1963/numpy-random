# numpy-random
An investigation of the numpy.random package

The ability to generate random numbers is an important part of any simulation.
Numpy provides various routines to do this through its numpy.random subpackage. 
In particular it uses an algorithm called the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) to generate pseudorandom numbers.
Computers and even people cannot, or find it difficult to generate pure random numbers. For this reason these types of numbers generated on computers are pseudorandom.

## The package
The overall purpose of the package is discussed on a Jupyter notebook.
The package is investigated with examples, to discuss Simple random data and Permutations.
The use and purpose of 5 Distribution functions in the package is examined.
Finally, the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers is explained.

## Uploading to GitHub
As with the Jupyter notebook for the Anscombe Quartet data, I could not upload my Jupyter notebook to GitHub. There seems to be a problem with my accessibility on my Command line mode.
